In the lab, we mix and swirl
Elements unite, a chemical world
Beakers bubbling, colors bright
Reactions dancing in the light

Oh, chemistry, a magical art
Atoms bonding, playing their part
From molecules small to structures grand
Understanding nature, hand in hand

Acids and bases, a pH scale
Titration's rhythm, a balancing tale
Electrons jumping, energy flows
The secrets of matter, chemistry knows
